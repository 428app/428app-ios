MAJOR BUGS
- iOS 9: Chat screen keyboard blocking on first load before collection view scroll: Try to figure out issue when coding ClassroomsController

MINOR BUGS
- Only allow copy of whole ChatCell: Wait for reply on stack overflow


!TOPICS!
- Store name and discipline in NSUSerDefaults - store this during sign up
- getUserFields upon opening app, and already set profileImage on coverImage etc. from Settings. After getting, reupdate name and discipline in NSUserDefaults


- observeClassrooms(uid)
- observeRecentClassroom(tid)
- observeClassroomMessages(tid)
- addClassroomMessage(msg, uid, name, discipline, timestamp)


!SETTINGS!
- Settings table
- Settings: Unselect cell upon cancel
- Mute, etc.


!PROFILE!
- Pre-load profile in ChatInboxController and pass it on
- Load in profile and pass it back to ChatInboxController

!SECURITY and INDEX SETTINGS!

!MODULARIZE CODE!
- Break down DataService into multiple services, delete DummyDataService

!TEST, TEST, TEST!

USER COMMENTS:
