Known issues in descending urgency:
1) Chat navigation title image is not centered together with label: ChatController: setupNavTitleView()
2) For chat that is not fully blocked by keyboard, should only scroll by diff and not whole height of keyboard: ChatController: handleKeyboardNotification()
3) Width of chat bubbles being a % of screen size (test on iphone 4s?): ChatCell: configureCell()
