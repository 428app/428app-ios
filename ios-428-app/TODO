Classrooms Firebase integration

**Multi-user chats in classrooms

- Superlatives logic
+ Submit votes firebase code, which updates memberHasVoted, and superlatives X
+ Share firebase, which updates memberHasVoted X
+ Firebase observe code on SuperlativesController that: Figures out running results (not final vs final), page state based on memberHasVoted, and also voted for list (shift from Classroom observe to Superlatives observe)
+ Discuss with Yihang how to populate "Did you know" into Share

+ After submitting votes, dim the screen and disable submit button

+ Share screen scrolling down
+ Upon sharing, screen shifts and does not look nice

- firstReplied

** Private messages

* Video answers? Image answers?
* Make "Type a Message" more obvious looking with a green background?
* GIFs in text?

MAJOR BUGS
- iOS 9: Chat screen keyboard blocking on first load before collection view scroll: Try to figure out issue when coding ClassroomsController

MINOR BUGS
- Only allow copy of whole ChatCell: Wait for reply on stack overflow


!TOPICS!
- Store name and discipline in NSUSerDefaults - store this during sign up
- getUserFields upon opening app, and already set profileImage on coverImage etc. from Settings. After getting, reupdate name and discipline in NSUserDefaults


- observeClassrooms(uid)
- observeRecentClassroom(tid)
- observeClassroomMessages(tid)
- addClassroomMessage(msg, uid, name, discipline, timestamp)


!SETTINGS!
- Settings table
- Settings: Unselect cell upon cancel
- Mute, etc.


!PROFILE!
- Pre-load profile in ChatController and pass it on
- Load in profile and pass it back to ChatController

!SECURITY and INDEX SETTINGS!

!MODULARIZE CODE!
- Break down DataService into multiple services, delete DummyDataService

!TEST, TEST, TEST!
