BUGS

Minor
- Profile photo shifting down upon clicking for time
- Settings: Unselect cell upon cancel

Major
- My messages sent out: previous messages being altered/hidden?
- If received/last sent is on and new message received, bubble has to go down a bit more on the receiver end
- Refreshing all chats with each chat
- Cover photo doesn't upload: Remove save, and upload automatically
- Setting new profile picture in user connections when another user changes
- Set security/index rules to speed up chat updates


!TOPICS!
- Store name and discipline in NSUSerDefaults - store this during sign up
- getUserFields upon opening app, and already set profileImage on coverImage etc. from Settings. After getting, reupdate name and discipline in NSUserDefaults


- observeTopics(uid)
- observeRecentTopic(tid)
- observeTopicMessages(tid)
- addTopicMessage(msg, uid, name, discipline, timestamp)







!SETTINGS!
- Settings table
- Mute, etc.


!SECURITY and INDEXp SETTINGS!



!TEST, TEST, TEST!



!OPTIMIZATION!
- Store Firebase data in code so we don't have to keep hitting the Firebase server







==== FRONTEND ====
TO NOTE:
- For login, set default cover photo and fb photo as profile pic, also pull name and age from FB
- Empty placeholder for no messages in DiscussController and ChatController (done after server)
- Read in location while reading FB info


Known issues in descending urgency:
1) When shifting up screen in EditProfessionalController and EditTaglineController as keyboard pops up, a bit of black background is seen (because self.view is shifted up, and reveals the black underneath)
2) For chat that is not fully blocked by keyboard, should only scroll by diff and not whole height of keyboard: ChatController: handleKeyboardNotification()
3) ChatController taking a long time to open
