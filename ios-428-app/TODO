+ FIXED BUG: Allowing empty input on profile tagline (Thanks Jenny)
+ FIXED BUG: isLoggedIn setting is true without other settings (unable to replicate, and rarely happens, but made some changes and I think I fixed this. Not a big issue regardless.)
+ FIXED BUG: Playpeers list are now ordered alphabetically, so they appear in the same order each time (Thanks Jenny)
+ FIXED BUG: Fixed views for iPhone SE: Question banner too small, privacy policy message cut off at login (Thanks Taira)
+ FIXED BUG: On chat screen if you highlight a word then go to profile screen, the highlight continues to appear in the background (Thanks Tomas)
+ IMPROVEMENT: Server - Randomized swap playgroup algorithm that reduces your chances of being with the exact same people in the next playgroup (not going to work very well now because there are only few playgroups and few users right now)
+ IMPROVEMENT: Explain to users how to get Inbox messages - decided a bit of explanation helps. (Thanks Jenny)
