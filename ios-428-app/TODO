!CHAT!
Bugs
- Refactor ChatController and View classes

New features
- Swipe right on chat screen to show time
- Click on chat bubble to Copy (Similar to tinder)
- Highlight links to open up UIWebView
- Chat bubbles alternating between tails and no tails


!CHAT RELATED OPTIONS!
- Add sent icon if last message sent by you in ConnectionsController
- Add top option to mute/report person
- Add top click to view person's profile



Nice to have:
1) Width of chat bubbles being a % of screen size (test on iphone 4s?)
2) Chat keyboard comes up more naturally
3) Match date when loading for pagination upwards
