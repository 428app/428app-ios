Classrooms Firebase integration

** Inbox

- Private Chats
+ Push notifications
    + Transfer to the right screen
+ Check if changing profile pic changes pic in classroom and private chats
+ Offline push notifications directing to the right chat message by using side effect

+ Investigate user settings not being set? Why? Is it because of log out clearing settings? Or settings simply do not get set at registration?

** Push notifications

+ Launching the app brings up the right screen via side effect as Notifications do not work yet


**Multi-user chats in classrooms

+ Superlatives Did you knows
+ Discipline icons at the bottom right of classmate pictures
+ firstReplied
+ Input actual questions

** Settings

+ Link website, privacy policy and terms

** Nice to haves

* Video answers? Video didyouknows?
* Make classroom icons larger
* Badges
* GIFs in text?

MAJOR BUGS
- iOS 9: Chat screen keyboard blocking on first load before collection view scroll: Try to figure out issue when coding ClassroomsController

MINOR BUGS
- Only allow copy of whole ChatCell: Wait for reply on stack overflow


!TOPICS!
- Store name and discipline in NSUSerDefaults - store this during sign up
- getUserFields upon opening app, and already set profileImage on coverImage etc. from Settings. After getting, reupdate name and discipline in NSUserDefaults


- observeClassrooms(uid)
- observeRecentClassroom(tid)
- observeClassroomMessages(tid)
- addClassroomMessage(msg, uid, name, discipline, timestamp)


!SETTINGS!
- Settings table
- Settings: Unselect cell upon cancel
- Mute, etc.


!PROFILE!
- Pre-load profile in ChatInboxController and pass it on
- Load in profile and pass it back to ChatInboxController

!SECURITY and INDEX SETTINGS!

!MODULARIZE CODE!
- Break down DataService into multiple services, delete DummyDataService

!TEST, TEST, TEST!

USER COMMENTS:
- Organization for students?
