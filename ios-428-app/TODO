!PROFILE!

GOALS OF TODAY:

- Problem with downloading images in connections (images replacing one another)
    - Replicate this by reinstalling app and downloading

- How to scroll down to bottom before view appears?

- Load profile
- Plan topics


!TOPICS!


!SETTINGS!
- Settings table
- Mute, etc.


!SECURITY SETTINGS!



!TEST, TEST, TEST!









==== FRONTEND ====
TO NOTE:
- For login, set default cover photo and fb photo as profile pic, also pull name and age from FB
- Empty placeholder for no messages in DiscussController and ChatController (done after server)
- Read in location while reading FB info


Known issues in descending urgency:
1) When shifting up screen in EditProfessionalController and EditTaglineController as keyboard pops up, a bit of black background is seen (because self.view is shifted up, and reveals the black underneath)
2) For chat that is not fully blocked by keyboard, should only scroll by diff and not whole height of keyboard: ChatController: handleKeyboardNotification()
3) ChatController taking a long time to open
