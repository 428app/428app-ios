- Connections titleView to countdown till 4:28



Known issues in descending urgency:
1) For chat that is not fully blocked by keyboard, should only scroll by diff and not whole height of keyboard: ChatController: handleKeyboardNotification()
2) Width of chat bubbles being a % of screen size (test on iphone 4s?): ChatCell: configureCell()
