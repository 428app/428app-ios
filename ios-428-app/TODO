!ENHANCEMENTS!
- Empty placeholder for no messages in DiscussController and ChatController



Known issues in descending urgency:
1) ChatController taking a long time to open
2) For chat that is not fully blocked by keyboard, should only scroll by diff and not whole height of keyboard: ChatController: handleKeyboardNotification()
3) When shifting up screen in EditProfessionalController and EditTaglineController as keyboard pops up, a bit of black background is seen (because self.view is shifted up, and reveals the black underneath)
