!TOPICS!
GOALS OF TODAY:
- Bug: Black area at bottom because the tab bar was being kept
- Plan topics




!SETTINGS!
- Settings table
- Mute, etc.


!SECURITY SETTINGS!



!TEST, TEST, TEST!



!OPTIMIZATION!
- Store Firebase data in code so we don't have to keep hitting the Firebase server







==== FRONTEND ====
TO NOTE:
- For login, set default cover photo and fb photo as profile pic, also pull name and age from FB
- Empty placeholder for no messages in DiscussController and ChatController (done after server)
- Read in location while reading FB info


Known issues in descending urgency:
1) When shifting up screen in EditProfessionalController and EditTaglineController as keyboard pops up, a bit of black background is seen (because self.view is shifted up, and reveals the black underneath)
2) For chat that is not fully blocked by keyboard, should only scroll by diff and not whole height of keyboard: ChatController: handleKeyboardNotification()
3) ChatController taking a long time to open
