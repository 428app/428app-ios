Just like future celebrities are unlikely to get their start with talent agencies, future content consumers will watch content online instead of at the theater, and probably in very different ways. Celebrities now have direct relationships with their fans. They can also distribute content in new ways. There are almost certainly huge new businesses that will get built as part of this shift.", date: t(daysAgo: 5))

This mismatch creates inefficiencies at almost every level of the financial system. It impacts how people invest their savings, how businesses gain access to capital to grow, how risk is priced and insured, and how financial firms do business with each other. We think that software will accelerate the pace at which financial services change and will eventually shift the nature of regulations. We want to fund companies with novel ideas of how to make that happen.", date: t(daysAgo: 6))

Unfortunately, securing computers isn’t just hard - it’s critically and increasingly important. As the software revolution continues and more critical information and systems are connected to the Internet, we become more vulnerable to cyberattacks and the disruption is more severe.", date: t(daysAgo: 7))

They should be reaching everyone.", imageName: "topic-nonprofits", description: "Why do so many people in the developing world still suffer for lack of simple things like bednets, vaccines, and iodized salt? Part of the problem is money, and we’re interested in new ways to get people to give. Part of it is execution, and we’d love to see nonprofits that are truly data-literate and metrics-driven closing these gaps.
